# Lambda Interpreter

## What is it?
```
It's an interpreter to simplify lambda expressions.
```

## How does it works?
```
The type of each lambda expression is ATOM, APPLICATION or ABSTRACTION. By analysing
the composition of input, the interpreter generates and entends an AST. Then, it 
applies computing rules to simplize the AST and gets the result.
```

## Version Information
```
The initial version:This is a preliminary procedure（you can run through the main 
method of Interpreter.java) and contains many flaws. Next I am going to Optimize these
codes，I may make them more OPP-like, Interpreter-like and more concise.
